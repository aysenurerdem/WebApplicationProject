					<h1>Will Fuller is confident in his hands, Texans are confident in him</h1>
					<h2>Posted On April 30th, 2016</h2>

					<p>HOUSTON -- The first two words out of general manager Rick Smith's mouth during his news conference Thursday night were these: "He's fast."</p>
					<p>That is receiver Will Fuller, briefly. But in the Houston Texans' estimation it's not all he is. On the biggest question that now remains about Fuller -- how he catches the football -- the Texans don't have concerns. Can he avoid the drops that plagued him during his career at Notre Dame? Are his hands strong enough to succeed in the NFL?

Both the Texans and Fuller believe he can.</p>
					
					<p>"I got over 140 catches in my career," Fuller said, without an air of defensiveness during a conference call with Houston reporters. "I’m a football player, that’s what I like to tell people. It doesn’t matter if I catch the ball with my body or my hand. A catch is a catch. I’m going to work at it my hardest to make everything look more fluid. I’m just coming in trying to help the team win."</p>
					<p>In selecting Fuller 21st overall, the Texans made him the third receiver they've ever taken in the first round. With Day 2's second- and third-round picks, the Texans could look to add an offensive lineman, a safety or a defensive end. All of those positions remain needs for Houston.

</p>
					<p>Historically, they've been very successful at drafting receivers early. The other two Texans first-round receivers -- DeAndre Hopkins (2013) and Andre Johnson (2003) made the Pro Bowl by their third seasons.

A receiving corps that includes Hopkins, Fuller, Jaelen Strong and Cecil Shorts is now the most talent the Texans have ever had at once at the position.

Hopkins is the centerpiece of the Texans' offense now. He doesn't have blazing speed, but he is phenomenal on contested catches. His 10-inch hands and the work he puts in on hand strength have led to a string of acrobatic one-handed catches that make even Odell Beckham Jr.'s jaw drop sometimes.

Fuller's strengths are reversed.</p>
					<p>"He's fast. He can run, OK," said Smith of the receiver who led all receivers with a 4.32 second 40-yard dash time. "That's his greatest attribute, obviously. ... But I think if you go back to our conversation a couple of days ago at the press conference when we talked about the two types of speed that we look for. Not only is he just straight-line, 40-yard dash fast, this guy plays extremely fast and quick."

His hands, though, have been criticized. According to Pro Football Focus, Fuller dropped 13.9 percent of catchable passes in 2015 and 12.64 percent of catchable passes in 2014. Drops are a very subjective statistic, so there might be some variance in these numbers.</p>
					<p>But Fuller's strengths -- his deep-ball ability and explosiveness -- combined with his willingness to learn and improve might outweigh this issue.

"Some of the things that he has to improve on I'm sure he'll come here and improve on," Texans coach Bill O'Brien said. "Whether it's route running or catching the ball in traffic more consistently, whatever it is. I believe he's a hard worker and he'll get better and better at that."

</p>
					<p>Fuller has already started working on his hands.

"The JUGS machine is not a good simulation of in-game things, but getting that repetition of catching the ball with my hands, extending my arms out, it helped me a lot, especially at the combine," he said. "I showed that I was catching everything with my hands. It’s more just looking it in with your eyes than anything."

Perhaps more importantly he extolled his work ethic. For the improvement O'Brien wants, that will be paramount.</p>
